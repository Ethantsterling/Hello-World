Hello-World
===========

The introductory repository for learning github.
New and improved to resolve the stated issue!
See, this isn't really meant to do anything.
Just as experience in using github, so that it's comfortable
when I want to use it for real work (or real play).

Toodles!

--Forked version.  Soon to be committed.
